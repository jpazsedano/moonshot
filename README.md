# moonshot

Moonshot (preliminary name) is a game to participate in the Game Off game jam.
The game is basically a golf game based in space, using physics to make the
ball follow interesting trayectories. The game will be 2D.

The player will start in a planet and the hole is in a different one. The idea is
to replicate all the elements that make golf games interesting and add an
interesting gravity and some other elements.
